# Python Intro fo Macro PhDs
PhD Course: 'Introduction to Python'
Lucas Kyriacou, University of Bern, December 2022

# Overview
Economists rely extensively on data, models and computational methods in order to gain understanding of how the world works, to offer policy advice and forecast the future. Nowadays many applications in research, policy institutions and industry can only be solved numerically on a computer.

# What is this Course about
This course aims to introduce PhD students to the basics of the popular and powerful programming language called Python. After going through the basics, we will also see some applications such as OLS regression, extraction of information from textual data, data visualization and object-oriented programming. In an extended version of this course we will further discuss various applications such as bulk downloading macroeconomic data, VAR estimation and solving macroeconomic models.

# Goal of this course
The goal is to provide PhD students with a variety of useful tools in Python that they can then apply to projects of their own choice or other programming languages.

# Teaching Material
The course material mostly consists of Jupyter notebooks, free guides and reference books. You can find more material at the end of the notebook.

# Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites other than being a PhD Student, preferably Macroeconomics as applications will be geared towards tools Macroeconomists frequently use.
